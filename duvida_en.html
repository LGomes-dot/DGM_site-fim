    <h3>Exhibition "Sow doubt, contemplate criticism"</h3>
    <p>Sow Doubt, Contemplate Criticism, exhibition by artists Ana Rita António and Yaw Tembe, opens November 12 at 6 pm in the hall of auditorium 1 of ESAD.CR, remaining until 25 November. It can be visited from 7 am to midnight, closing on weekends and holidays. The curatorship and production of this event were ensured by the students of the 3rd and 2nd year of the degree in Cultural Programming and Production, respectively. Project within the scope of the 3rd cycle of the Cubicle.</p>
    <p>The works presented will be “Mantra” by Ana Rita António and “My Private Mask Collection” by Yam Tembe.</p>
    <p>Ana Rita António (Leiria, 1980) is a multidisciplinary artist who lives and works between Lisbon and Bergen. After graduating in Fine Arts at ESAD.CR, she completed her master's degree in Bergen at the National Academy of Arts.</p>
    <p>His work emerges as a fusion between design and the fine arts. The artist describes her project as a composition of analogies between the trivial and the random. Speaking simultaneously the bold and the unexpected with a sense of improvisation, self-sufficiency and temporality, his work questions the coercion that derives from the deeper meaning and superficial aesthetic appearance of contemporary contexts, objects or images.</p>
    <p>Yaw Tembe (Swaziland, 1989) is a visual artist and musician living and working in Lisbon. He completed his degree in Sculpture at FBAUP, then turned to the trumpet. Understanding sound as an autonomous element of music, he develops various projects in the field of jazz, experimental, improvised and electroacoustic music, which he carries out alongside other initiatives in the context of the fine arts. Tembe, who founded the Intervention Workshops in Lisbon, characterizes his work as fragile and ephemeral, marked by processes that cross the various areas of creation, from music to the fine arts to dance. The Cubicle is a project created under the Cultural Programming and Production degree that aims to program and produce cultural events in the main disciplinary areas of ESAD.cr. The program will be framed in the Forum Arts and Sustainability, which includes a space for debate, research and research on transition and contemporary artistic practices that critically perspective the environmental and social transformations that accompany it. In this context, the programming will be balanced between national and international artists whose practices are developed in different cultural areas.</p>
    <p>The exhibition runs from 12 to 25 November 2019 at ESAD.CR</p>
